This repository features a comprehensive design of a V6 engine along with an integrated cooling system, created using Autodesk Fusion 360. This design is intended for use in automotive applications, providing detailed insights into the engine's mechanical structure and the cooling system's efficiency.

In my V6 engine design, I've arranged six cylinders in a V shape (at 90 deg), with three cylinders on each side. This configuration is compact and balances performance and efficiency. The engine operates through a four-stroke cycle: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. In the intake stroke, the piston within each cylinder moves down, allowing a mixture of air and fuel to enter. Next, during the compression stroke, the piston moves up, compressing this mixture tightly. A spark plug then ignites the compressed fuel-air mixture, causing a controlled explosion that forces the piston down in the power stroke. Finally, the piston moves up again in the exhaust stroke, expelling the burnt gases through the exhaust valve.

The pistons' up-and-down motion is converted into rotational motion by the crankshaft, which then powers the vehicle's wheels. To ensure the engine runs smoothly and doesn't overheat, I've designed an efficient cooling system. This system includes a high-efficiency radiator, an electric water pump for consistent coolant flow, and a thermostat to regulate the engine's temperature. Durable, heat-resistant hoses and connections ensure reliable coolant circulation, while electric fans provide additional airflow through the radiator when needed. This comprehensive cooling system ensures my V6 engine maintains optimal performance and longevity.

Working of Cooling System
I've designed a cooling system that's tailored for efficient heat dissipation in a vehicle's engine. The heart of the system lies in its utilization of water as a coolant (liquid cooling system). This coolant is pumped through a network of components to effectively regulate the engine's temperature and prevent overheating. At the core of this setup is the radiator, which serves as the primary heat exchanger. It features an opening at the top for easy coolant refilling (another feature which could be added- expansion tank to manage pressure changes of the coolant ).
The water pump plays a critical role in circulating the coolant from the radiator to the engine's pistons. In my design, the coolant is directed through hose pipes to envelop(peripherally) the six pistons in case of a V6 engine. This lets the coolant to absorb heat from the aluminium engine material, effectively cooling it down and maintaining optimal operating temperatures- especially during combustion cycle for a 4-stroke engine. To further fine-tune temperature control, I've integrated a thermostat into the system. This component ensures that the coolant remains within the ideal temperature range, preventing both overheating and unnecessary cooling.
 A radiator is usually placed at the front of the vehicle so that the high temperature coolant cooling take place naturally due to the wind flows.
To enhance cooling efficiency, especially in scenarios like heavy traffic where airflow is restricted, I've incorporated a fan into the design. Positioned on the V-shaped structure, the fan draws air over the radiator, facilitating additional heat dissipation. Furthermore, I've implemented sub-hoses to manage coolant flow based on temperature levels. One sub-hose is dedicated to carrying coolant that has reached high temperatures, typically exiting the engine after absorbing heat from combustion. This high-temperature coolant is directed through the radiator, where it undergoes cooling as air passes over the radiator's fins. By utilizing the radiator's cooling capacity, the system efficiently lowers the temperature of the coolant before it re-enters circulation. This allows for precise control over coolant circulation, ensuring that it's directed where it's needed most. By combining these elements into a cohesive design, my cooling system offers effective thermal management for automotive applications, enhancing engine performance and longevity.
